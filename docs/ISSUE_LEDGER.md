# Issue ledger

Running log of every problem hit while building SCIO, with how and when it was resolved. Add an entry when the problem is found; complete it when it is resolved. Each resolved entry records the **sweep**: the search made for the same mistake elsewhere and what it found. Statuses: `open`, `resolved`, `wontfix` (with reason).

Template:

```
### I-NNN · <short title>
- Found: <date> · <milestone> · <where: file, command, step>
- Symptom: <what was observed, exact error text if short>
- Root cause: <the actual mistake, not the symptom>
- Fix: <what changed, commit or PR>
- Sweep: <pattern searched, scope, instances found and fixed, guard added>
- Resolved: <date> · Status: open | resolved | wontfix

### I-001 · Multi-file bash heredoc batch aborted
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · writing 12 prompt templates in one Bash command with chained `cat > f <<'EOF'` blocks
- Symptom: `unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''`; no files written
- Root cause: a single shell command carrying twelve quoted heredocs was mangled by the command wrapper before bash parsed it; the apostrophes in the template prose ended up outside a heredoc
- Fix: templates written one file per tool call (`Write`), content unchanged
- Sweep: all other heredoc uses in the session were single-file and succeeded; rule added to `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (one heredoc per command when the body contains quotes)
- Resolved: 2026-10-10 · Status: resolved

### I-002 · `uv sync` fails with `invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer`
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · first `uv sync --all-extras --group dev`
- Symptom: TLS error fetching `pypi.org` metadata
- Root cause: the machine trusts PyPI through the system certificate store (proxy or corporate CA); uv's bundled store does not include it
- Fix: `uv sync --native-tls`; documented in README usage and CLAUDE.md
- Sweep: CI runs on GitHub-hosted runners and is unaffected; no other network tooling in M1
- Resolved: 2026-10-10 · Status: resolved

### I-003 · OpenTelemetry tracer provider can be set only once per process
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · `tests/unit/test_harness_core.py` span tests, 2 failures
- Symptom: `Overriding of current TracerProvider is not allowed`; second test's exporter saw no spans
- Root cause: `configure_tracing()` built a fresh `TracerProvider` and called `set_tracer_provider` on every call; OTel ignores all but the first
- Fix: `configure_tracing` creates the global provider once and attaches each exporter to it; tests use one session-scoped in-memory exporter cleared per test (`tests/conftest.py`)
- Sweep: searched `scio/` for other process-global registrations set per call (`set_tracer_provider`, `logging.basicConfig`, `set_meter_provider`): only this one. `Settings` is built per call by design and is not global state
- Resolved: 2026-10-10 · Status: resolved

### I-004 · mypy `no-any-return` from integer power and untyped walker
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · `uv run mypy`
- Symptom: `Returning Any` in `scio/harness/retry.py` and `scio/prompt/wire_schema.py`
- Root cause: `2**attempt` with an `int` exponent is typed `Any` by mypy; the recursive `_walk` returns `Any` by design and was returned unchecked
- Fix: `2.0**attempt`; `assert isinstance(result, dict)` at the single public boundary
- Sweep: `grep -rn "\*\*" scio/` finds no other integer-power expressions used in typed returns; mypy `strict` stays on so recurrences fail CI
- Resolved: 2026-10-10 · Status: resolved

### I-005 · `ruff format` rewrites Python code blocks inside Markdown
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md` changed after `ruff format .`
- Symptom: aligned comments and wrapped lists in the M0 State code block were reflowed; README snippet flagged as unformatted
- Root cause: ruff formats fenced Python blocks in Markdown files it is pointed at
- Fix: accepted (consistent formatting, no semantic change); `ruff format --check .` is part of the local pre-push command so docs stay formatted
- Sweep: all `.md` files run through `ruff format` in CI; no other code-bearing docs exist yet
- Resolved: 2026-10-10 · Status: resolved

### I-006 · CRLF line endings introduced by Python-written patches on Windows
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · git warnings at commit; `ruff format --check` flagged README
- Symptom: 6 tracked files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `scio/harness/core.py`, `scio/prompt/repair.py`, `scripts/check_docs.py`) had CRLF
- Root cause: `Path.write_text()` in text mode on Windows translates `\n` to `\r\n` unless `newline="\n"` is passed; exactly the files patched that way were affected
- Fix: files normalized to LF; `evals/report.py` writes now pass `newline="\n"`
- Sweep: `grep -rn "write_text(" scio evals scripts tests | grep -v newline=` found `evals/report.py` (fixed) and two test fixtures writing single-line files (harmless); rule added to CONTRIBUTING "File hygiene" and CLAUDE.md; `.gitattributes` already enforces LF in the repo
- Resolved: 2026-10-10 · Status: resolved

### I-007 · Push rejected: OAuth token lacks `workflow` scope
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · `git push -u origin feat/1-harness`
- Symptom: `refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow .github/workflows/ci.yml without workflow scope`
- Root cause: the `gh` login token has scopes `gist, read:org, repo`; GitHub requires `workflow` to push workflow files
- Fix: run `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow` (interactive, needs the browser), then push again
- Sweep: any future push adding files under `.github/workflows/` needs the scope; noted in LESSONS_LEARNED pre-flight list
- Resolved: — · Status: open (needs the repo owner to refresh the token)

### I-008 · pdoc cannot resolve PEP 695 type parameters under `from __future__ import annotations`
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · `python scripts/gen_api_docs.py`
- Symptom: `Error parsing type annotation StructuredResult[T] ... name 'T' is not defined` (warnings; docs still built)
- Root cause: ruff's `UP047` rewrote generics to `def f[T: BaseModel](...)`; pdoc evaluates the stringified annotations and cannot see the scoped type parameter
- Fix: none yet (cosmetic)
- Sweep: only `scio/prompt/repair.py` uses PEP 695 generics; if the warning matters, drop the `__future__` import in that module
- Resolved: — · Status: open (low)

### I-010 · Backslash escapes unescaped when Python patch scripts are passed through the shell tool
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M1 · patching `evals/report.py` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` from a Python heredoc; found by the file-change notice and `grep -n 'newline='`
- Symptom: `newline="\n"` landed in both files as a quote, a real line break, and a quote; `report.py` no longer parsed
- Root cause: the shell tool wrapper processes `\\n` inside the command text before bash sees the quoted heredoc, so Python received a literal newline instead of the two characters backslash-n. Same class as I-001 (command text transformed before the shell parses it)
- Fix: both files repaired with the file-edit tool; the patch script avoided writing any escape sequence through the shell
- Sweep: `grep -rn -A1 'newline=' CONTRIBUTING.md evals/report.py` plus a tree-wide search for lines ending in a dangling quote found exactly these two sites; rule added to LESSONS_LEARNED pre-flight item 6: edit files containing backslash escapes with the file tools, never via a shell-embedded script
- Resolved: 2026-10-10 · Status: resolved

### I-009 · Branch protection unavailable on a private free-plan repository
- Found: 2026-10-10 · M0 · `gh api repos/.../rulesets`
- Symptom: `Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this feature` (403)
- Root cause: rulesets and branch protection on private repos require GitHub Pro
- Fix: none; the no-direct-push and no-force-push rules are convention (CONTRIBUTING) until the repo is public or the plan changes
- Sweep: n/a
- Resolved: — · Status: open (owner decision)
